# week-1-challenge

## Description


## Installation

N/A, it's a webpage.

## Usage

The webpage can be found [here]()

The navigation links at the top-right of the page will guide the user to the corresponding sections of the page.

The following is the mock-up image provided for the project; you should notice that there is only a slight visual difference between my launched page, made to improve the contract between the text and background

## Credits

I was given the starter code for this project by Washington Univerity St.Louis Coding Bootcamp.

For this project I utilzed the Axe Devtools Chrome extension to check the accessibilty of the webpage as I worked on it.

I used the following webpages to guide me about using semantic html elements and proper use of alt attributes, as well as for assistance in writing this readme.

[Art of Alt Attributes](https://accessible360.com/accessible360-blog/2020-11-10-the-art-of-alt-attributes/)
