# week-1-challenge

## Description

This is the first Challenge assigned to me by the Washington University Coding Boot Camp. The challenge was to take the premade html and css code for a company webpage, and refactor it; make the code cleaner and more organized, and to bring it up to accessibily standards, but without changing the appearance of how the webpage initially looked. These changes to the code make it easier for others to access and work with the code, make it better optimized for search engines to find the company's page, and help prevent the company from getting into any legal touble for having their page be difficult, or not possible, for people who have disabilities, such as blindness or color-blindness, to access and use the page.

Through this project, I learned that it is important to use specific semantic html tags when applicable, that it is important to use alt tags on images and to be wary of what colors are used for text and backgrounds, and got some more practice in styling with css through some trial and error in the process of cleaning up and consolidating the stylesheet elements.

## Installation

N/A, it's a webpage.

## Usage

The webpage can be found [here]()

The navigation links at the top-right of the page will guide the user to the corresponding sections of the page.

The following is the mock-up image provided for the project; you should notice that there is only a slight visual difference between my launched page, made to improve the contract between the text and background

## Credits

I was given the starter code for this project by Washington Univerity St.Louis Coding Bootcamp.

For this project I utilzed the Axe Devtools Chrome extension to check the accessibilty of the webpage as I worked on it.

I used the following webpages to guide me about using semantic html elements and proper use of alt attributes, as well as for assistance in writing this readme.
